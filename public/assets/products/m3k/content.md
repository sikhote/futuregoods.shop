The M3k is _the_ premium gaming mouse. It is light, stripped down to 2 buttons only, and makes your aim as responsive as possible. If you miss, it's your fault.

## Why we recommend it

### It's light

It is the lightest production mouse in the world, which is important for quick aiming. A mouse is first, and foremost, a pointing device.

### It's responsive

It has a 8,000 polling rate available, which means every movement you make will be transmitted to the computer that much quicker.

### It's wired

A mouse without wires is great, for a while...then you have to charge it. Eventually, everyone will enter a situation where they want to play a game, but their mouse is not charged. Sure, you can commit to charging a mouse every time you leave the computer, but this fails time and again. The wire on the M3K is different than the typical USB cord you are using, it's extremely light and barely there. You don't even need a mouse bungie.

Another great benefit to a wired connection is you never need to worry about lag, interference, or hiccups in the connection. It's always on and ready for a game.

Lastly, without a battery to power a wireless mode, this mouse can become lighter than anything else out there.

## What we don't like

Sure, it's nice to have a mouse wheel. Gaming without one means you will need to creatively bind some keys. We think this is a worthy tradeoff.

## What the company says

The tl;dr of the M3K is that with a weight of just 24 grams it still is the worlds lightest production gaming mouse. And thanks to a wired 8,000 hertz connection it still has the worlds lowest latencies as well. In fact, thanks to an upgraded sensor, the latency is even less than that of the M2K.
